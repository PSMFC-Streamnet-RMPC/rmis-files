# RMIS Files

This project uses primarily vanilla javascript and Bootstrap to create a user login and list of logged-in user data files with file upload functionality. This is an example of interacting with the [**RMIS API**](https://github.com/PSMFC-Streamnet-RMPC/rmis-api). Uppy JS is used for multiple file upload functionality, and JQuery ajax is used for API calls instead of JS fetch to simplify the API interaction.

## Requirements

[**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/): A CSS framework for creating responsive and mobile-friendly websites (Version 4.1)

[**Uppy JS**](https://uppy.io/): Uppy is a JavaScript file uploader that allows for easy file uploads from various sources, such as local files, remote URLs, and cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox. (Version 3.3)

[**JQuery**](https://jquery.com/): A JS library that makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler (Version 3.4.1)
